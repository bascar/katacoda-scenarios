In this step, we will check the state of our sample MariaDB database.

### Step: Verify data

Below commands exec into the running mariadb pod and dump our sample database.

First find the pod name and exec into the container.
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=mariadb-snap | grep Running | grep 1/1 | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD bash
```{{execute T1}}

Now use mariadb to make sure our data is still there.
```
mariadb --password=$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
show databases;
use pxdb;
show tables;
select count(*) from a;
exit
exit
```{{execute T1}}

Observe that the database table is still there and all the content intact!
